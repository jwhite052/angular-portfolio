    <blockquote>

At it’s heart, this is a resource for those with the drive to learn and grow as a developer. Like others, I’m a learn by example kind of guy. I’d prefer to learn with my text editor – plugging away on my command-line interface, learning as I go. Working on this site helps me do just that. It allows me to sort through and package up my thoughts, ideas, and projects in a way that is not only helpful to me but also useful for others.</p>`,
